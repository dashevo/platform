Dash Platform is a technology stack for building decentralized applications on the Dash network. 
The two main architectural components, Drive and DAPI, turn the Dash P2P network into a cloud that 
developers can integrate with their applications.

If you are looking for how to contribute to the project or need any help with building an app on 
the Dash Platform - message us in [Devs Discord](https://chat.dashdevs.org/)!

## Intro

Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.


Try it out at our [REPL](https://babel.dev/repl#?browsers=defaults%2C%20not%20ie%2011&loose=true&code_lz=GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAcwE4FN1QBQzABxCgEpEBvAKEUQyhFST0KkQH5XEAiACXQBs-cRAHc4qPgBNOAbgoBfIA&shippedProposals=true&sourceType=script&lineWrap=true&presets=env%2Cenv&prettier=true).
