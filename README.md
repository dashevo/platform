Dash Platform is a technology stack for building decentralized applications on the Dash network. 
The two main architectural components, Drive and DAPI, turn the Dash P2P network into a cloud that 
developers can integrate with their applications.

If you are looking for how to contribute to the project or need any help with building an app on 
the Dash Platform - message us on the [Devs Discord](https://chat.dashdevs.org/)!

## Intro

This is a multi-package repository - sometimes also known as monorepository - that contains
all packages that comprise the Dash platform - for example, Drive, which is the 
storage component of Dash Platform, the JavaScript SDK, wallet-lib, DAPI, and others. 
Every individual package contains its own readme. Packages are located in the
[packages](./packages) directory.
